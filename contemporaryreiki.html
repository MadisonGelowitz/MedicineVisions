            <h1>How does it work?</h1>
            Healing takes place as long as the person wants to heal or receive Life Force Energy on any level. It is not necessary to believe in it for it to work, it will work anyway. The best way to learn about Reiki is to experience it yourself. During Reiki treatments, the client remains fully clothed and gentle healing hands are placed on their chakra centers, as well as other documented areas. You may feel the hands warm up in certain places and that means you are taking in Life Force Energy. All you are responsible for doing is relaxing your mind, breathing deeply in order to begin the relaxation process, and to have an open heart to healing. Just relax and enjoy the session. Many of my clients fall asleep and dream deeply. Some clients release emotions and cry a little during their session. This is not uncommon and should not be of concern. Some clients see colors, lights, Spirit Guides, Angels, Spirit Animals or images and messages from loved ones who have passed on.
            <br /><br />
            Healing is one step at a time and not all healing will take place in one single session. Reiki healing is subtle and heals at a very deep level. You may not even know what is being healed at the time. Just be in the moment, listen to your intuitive guidance and let the Reiki flow. The more relaxed you are, the better the energy flows. We simply ask that ‘whatever needs to happen during this session, let it happen for the Highest Good of all’. Credit is given to the client for healing.  A Reiki practitioner is simply someone who is trained to channel the Life Force Energy and assist the process of healing. Reiki is not meant to take the place of conventional diagnosis or treatment of illnesses but can be an effective tool to compliment and assists them.
