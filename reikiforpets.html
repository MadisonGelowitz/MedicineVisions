            <h1>Reiki for Animals and Others</h1>
            Animals love having Reiki healing sessions. You can tell by the way they become quiet and by the relaxed look on their faces that express they are sensing and enjoying the Life Force Energy being channeled. Animals can simply tell when someone truly cares about them and is trying to help. Animals sense how much energy they can absorb and I’ve noticed that when a small dogs or cats has had enough energy, they become fidgety. I can also tell when the energy is enough, usually this is after five to ten minutes. Children and babies also require less Reiki energy but love it as well. The elderly and the dying can improve their quality of life with Reiki and if they are unable to come to us, we are taught how to send the energy over long distances. Crystals are sometimes used on the chakra (energy centers) during sessions in order to enhance the flow of energy through the pathways. Crystals can also be utilized to remove past life influences that are usually thicker and denser types of energy.
