            <h1>Distance reading</h1>
            A distant reading or remote perception can be conducted without the reader ever meeting the client in person and includes can include e-mail or telephone readings. As psychics utilize clairvoyance, clairaudience, clairsentience, claircognizance and clairescence for Divination, visual contact is not required.
            <h1>Psychometry</h1>
            Psychometry is obtaining information about a person, through holding an object or piece of clothing that was worn by them. Energy emanates from all living things and is powerful enough to be absorbed by non-living things they have owned. This is called an energy imprint. Psychometry is the ability to feel this energy and interpret it. This perception can come from visions, smells, sounds, emotions and physical sensations.
            <h1>Remote viewing</h1>
            Remote viewing is the gathering of information through psychic means from a distance. It allows a psychic to perceive and describe details about places they have never been, people they have never seen personally and situations that have occurred or are could occur in the future.
            <h1>Retrocognition</h1>
            Retro cognition is the perception of past events that have already taken place.
            <h1>Scrying</h1>
            Scrying is the use of an item to view people and events at a distance, in the future or that have already taken place. It is achieved by holding an object that the psychic focuses her gaze into until a vision appears. The most common objects used for scrying may include a mirror, water or crystals.
