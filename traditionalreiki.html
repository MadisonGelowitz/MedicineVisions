            <h1>History of Reiki</h1>
            Written records date Reiki back to 2500 years ago and the symbol formulas are found in ancient texts from Northern India and Tibet where it is believed to have originated. It is believed to date back to even more ancient times such as in the time of Atlantis and the continent of MU.  Dr. Mikao Usui, a Japanese Monk and teacher, rediscovered the technique of Reiki in the late 1800’s and named them Reiki, often called Usui Reiki, named in honor of him. After meditating for three weeks on Mt. Koriyama, a light struck his third eye (which I consider to be a moment of Enlightenment) and gave him information on the symbol formulas, as well as what they meant and how and under which circumstances to use them. Coming down the mountain he experienced what is known as the Four Miracles. He healed himself of two physical ailments, he healed a young teen aged girl who was serving him a meal and he healed an arthritic monk, upon his return to the monastery.
            <h1>How does Reiki work?</h1>
            Reiki energy flows into the practitioner, through their body and out their hands. The practitioner’s energy does not transfer to the patient. The practitioner’s energy and the patients energy is kept separate by the ancient Japanese symbols used and by the intention set by the practitioner. Only the Universal Life Force Energy is transferred to the patient. As Reiki is flowing through the practitioner they receive Reiki healing at the same time as they are giving Reiki to another. Reiki practitioners are not using their own energy but are channeling ‘Universal Life Force’ so they do not use their own energy or become depleted in any way, after a session. As a matter of fact, I tend to feel very calm, balanced and energized after the session I give. The Life Force Energy comes down through the crown chakra and up through the feet from Mother Earth. This Life Force will clean out the chakra system as one agrees to become a channel of energy. Therefore Reiki is an excellent path for self development and Healing.
